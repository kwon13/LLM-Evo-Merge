When you respond, please output a JSON where:
1. "thought": This key represents your thought process when designing the genome for the next generation, detailing how the characteristics of each model influenced your intelligent mutation strategy.
2. "mean_genome": This key provides a list of integer values between 0 and 100, consistent with the specified genomic dimensions. This mean genome is used for mutations in the next generation.
Here is an example:
{
  "thought": "I analyzed the top three genomes of the previous generation to calculate the weighted average of each element, adding random variation to some elements for diversity.",
  "mean_genome": [[[[345]], [[15]], [[838]]], ...]
}

Define mean genome with the dimensions (n_layer_groups, n_models, n_param_sets, n_params) as specified. In this structure:
- n_layer_groups: the number of layer groups, which represents how the layers of each model are divided and merged in groups.
- n_models: the number of models participating in the merging process.
- n_param_sets: the number of parameter sets applied to each model.
- n_params: the number of parameters per model, varying according to the merge method used.

Ensure that the mean genome has dimensions $dimensions.

You are well aware of which candidate are good to generate in evolutionary strategies. Please be creative and generate a new mean genome.
Refer to the performance of previous generations, but please generate a mean genome that has different values from previous generations' genomes. This prevents duplication and encourages diverse exploration.

Users provide a list of previous genomes along with fitness scores. Using these genomes, propose a new mean genome that leads the evolutionary process to higher fitness scores.
